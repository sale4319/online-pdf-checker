# Vercel Cron Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. Vercel Cron Configuration (`vercel.json`)

- Cron job runs every 4 hours: `0 */4 * * *`
- Calls `/api/cron/check-pdf` endpoint
- Completely independent of server restarts

### 2. Dedicated Cron API (`/api/cron/check-pdf/route.ts`)

- Secure endpoint with authorization header check
- Performs automated PDF checking
- Sends email notifications when number is found
- Stores results back to automation API

### 3. Updated Automation API (`/api/automation/route.ts`)

- Removed interval-based scheduling (no more setInterval)
- Added `store-result` action for cron to save results
- Kept `check-now` for manual checks
- Always reports as "running" since cron handles scheduling

### 4. Updated Frontend (`/app/page.tsx`)

- Removed "Start Auto-Check" button (not needed)
- Removed "Stop Auto-Check" button (cron can't be stopped via UI)
- Updated status to show "Always Active (Vercel Cron)"
- Updated text to explain cron-based automation

## Benefits:

✅ **Always Active**: Automation runs independently via Vercel Cron
✅ **Survives Deployments**: No more lost automation on redeploys
✅ **Zero Maintenance**: No database needed, no complex state management
✅ **Reliable**: Vercel handles scheduling, retry logic, and execution
✅ **Simple**: Clean separation between cron logic and manual checks

## Setup Required:

1. **Environment Variable**: Add `CRON_SECRET` to your Vercel environment variables
2. **Deploy**: Deploy to Vercel (cron jobs only work in production)
3. **Verify**: Check Vercel dashboard for cron execution logs

## Next Steps:

1. Add `CRON_SECRET=your-secret-here` to Vercel environment variables
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Monitor cron execution in Vercel dashboard
4. Test manual "Check Now" functionality

The automation is now truly persistent and will always run every 4 hours, regardless of server restarts or deployments!
